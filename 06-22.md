## Morality and Religion

- Religion is one of the oldest ethical models
- There is an idea that someone must have created ethical law. Religion puts this role as attirbuted to God
- Potential Problems:
	- Religiously based ethics tend to change over time based on social norms
	- Lack of individual decision making and morals (whether this is a problem or not is up for debate)
	- Multiple religions creates a lack of a unified religious ethical model
- Potential Benefits:
	- Religiously based ethics are often straightforward to follow
	- Most religions offer some incentive for being good and moral
	- Decision making can be delegated to God

## Euthyphro

- This story takes place during the time of the Greek Gods
	- Polytheistic (multiple gods)
	- the gods resemble humans in their appearence and actions
	- the Greeks used them as a moral guide in Ancient Greece
		- in turn, the Greek Gods are also flawed

- In the story, Socrates and Euthyphro meet. Euthyphro is on his way to prosecute his own father, which shocks Socrates
- Socrates and Euthyphro have a long discussion about piety
- Euthyphro offers three pious definitions/explanations
	1. What he is on his way to do is pious
		- Socrates did not want an example of a pious action, so he is dissatisfied with this explanation
	2. What is dear to the gods is pious, what is not is impious
		- Socrates points out that, since there are multiple gods, certain gods ok certain things and certain gods don't
	3. Pious is what all the gods love, and the opposite, what all the gods hate, is the impious
		- Socrates asks something along the lines of, "is good good because the gods say good is good, or do the gods say good is good since good is good?"
