## Utilitarianism

- Perks
	- Based on communal interests
	- Focused on outcomes and consequences

- Problems
	- Who defines well-being?
	- Requires a ton of data
	- Requires a lot of thinking
	- Lack of absolutes (this could be a perk depending on your POV?)

- Noteworthy for including animals in its philosophy
	- Animals are included because they can suffer
	- Animals are not moral agents

## Animal Rights

- Why do we eat animals?
	- They are part of the food chain (this would be a scientific response)
		- You could also argue, however, that humans are outside of the food chain
	- God says humans have dominion over animals (this would be a religious response)
	- It is not necessary anymore with the rise of agriculture

- Arguments for human exceptionalism rely on the fact that humans are moral agents
